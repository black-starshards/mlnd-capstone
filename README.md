# mlnd-capstone

**TO REVIEWER: Please note this is an incomplete submission. I am looking for feedback on the ~60% of the project I have completed so far (mainly on the report). Thanks.**

I did not elect to do the capstone proposal for this project.

### Requirements
`numpy` (included in Anaconda)
`pandas` (included in Anaconda)
`haversine` (can be installed with `pip install haversine`)
`xgboost==0.6` (can be installed with `pip install xgboost` on Linux - on windows it can be obtained from Anaconda cloud)

### Dataset
The dataset can be obtained from the Kaggle competition page: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data (signup required)
`train.csv` and `test.csv` must be unzipped and placed in the `data/` folder in this repository for code to run.

### Code running order
From inside the code/ folder:
1. `python processing.py`
2. `python engineering.py`
To be continued...
